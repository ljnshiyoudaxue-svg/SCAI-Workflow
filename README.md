# DeepSeek-FractureVug
Semantic-constrained framework for reproducible fracture–vug interpretation from micro-resistivity imaging logs.

## Overview
This repository contains code developed for the study:

**Article**: A Semantic-Constrained Computational Framework for Reproducible Fracture–Vug Interpretation from Micro-Resistivity Imaging Logs  
**Corresponding Author**: Jianing Li

The pipeline performs:
- Micro-resistivity image segmentation and fracture/vug detection
- Feature extraction and parameter quantification
- Automated report generation

## Requirements
Python 3.9+ with packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
